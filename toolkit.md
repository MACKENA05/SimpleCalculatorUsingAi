## 5. Minimal Working Example

### What the Example Does
A simple calculator that:
- Takes two numbers from user
- Asks for operation (+, -, *, /)
- Shows the result
- Handles basic errors

### Code (Calculator.java)
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Calculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.println("üßÆ Simple Java Calculator");
        System.out.println("========================");
        
        // Get first number
        System.out.print("Enter first number: ");
        double num1 = scanner.nextDouble();
        
        // Get operation
        System.out.print("Enter operation (+, -, *, /): ");
        char operation = scanner.next().charAt(0);
        
        // Get second number
        System.out.print("Enter second number: ");
        double num2 = scanner.nextDouble();
        
        // Calculate result
        double result = 0;
        boolean validOperation = true;
        
        switch (operation) {
            case '+':
                result = num1 + num2;
                break;
            case '-':
                result = num1 - num2;
                break;
            case '*':
                result = num1 * num2;
                break;
            case '/':
                if (num2 != 0) {
                    result = num1 / num2;
                } else {
                    System.out.println("‚ùå Error: Cannot divide by zero!");
                    validOperation = false;
                }
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("‚ùå Error: Invalid operation!");
                validOperation = false;
        }
        
        // Show result
        if (validOperation) {
            System.out.println("‚úÖ Result: " + num1 + " " + operation + " " + num2 + " = " + result);
        }
        
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

### How to Run
```bash
# Compile the Java file
javac Calculator.java

# Run the program
java Calculator
```
#### Alternative: One-line compile and run
```bash
javac Calculator.java && java Calculator
```

### Expected Output
```
üßÆ Simple Java Calculator
========================
Enter first number: 10
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): +
Enter second number: 5
‚úÖ Result: 10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
```

## 6. AI Prompt Journal (Using ai.moringaschool.com)

### Prompt 1: Basic Structure
**Prompt Used**: "Create a simple calculator program using Java that takes two numbers and performs basic operations. Include proper variable naming and comments."

**AI Response Summary**: The AI provided a clean structure with Scanner for input, switch statement for operations, and basic error handling. It also suggested using descriptive variable names and adding user-friendly output messages.

**Evaluation**: Very helpful - gave me the exact structure I needed with clear explanations. The AI understood the context well.

### Prompt 2: Error Handling
**Prompt Used**: "How do I handle division by zero and invalid operations in Java? Show me best practices for input validation."

**AI Response Summary**: AI suggested using if-else conditions for division by zero, a default case in switch for invalid operations, and mentioned try-catch blocks for more advanced error handling.

**Evaluation**: Perfect for making the program more robust and user-friendly. The AI provided both simple and advanced solutions.

### Prompt 3: Code Improvement
**Prompt Used**: "Review my Java calculator code and suggest improvements for readability and functionality. What Java best practices should I follow?"

**AI Response Summary**: The AI recommended:
- Adding comments for clarity
- Using meaningful variable names
- Consistent formatting and indentation
- Proper resource management (closing Scanner)
- Adding user-friendly output with emojis

**Evaluation**: Excellent feedback that helped improve code quality and user experience.

### Prompt 4: Learning Reflection
**Prompt Used**: "What key Java concepts does this calculator project demonstrate? How can I extend it to learn more advanced concepts?"

**AI Response Summary**: The AI identified key concepts (variables, data types, input/output, control structures, methods) and suggested extensions like:
- Adding a loop for multiple calculations
- Creating separate methods for each operation
- Adding more mathematical functions
- Implementing a simple GUI

**Evaluation**: Great for understanding the learning objectives and planning next steps.

## 7. Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: "javac not recognized"
**Problem**: Command not found when trying to compile.
**Solution**: Make sure Java is installed and added to PATH environment variable.

### Issue 2: InputMismatchException
**Problem**: Program crashes when user enters text instead of numbers.
**Solution**: For now, just restart the program. Advanced: Add try-catch blocks.

### Issue 3: Wrong decimal results
**Problem**: Division results look weird (like 0.33333333).
**Solution**: This is normal! Java shows many decimal places.
